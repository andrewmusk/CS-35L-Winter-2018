We test our various sfrob implementations

Firstly we test with a large file

sfrob

time cat large.txt | ./sfrob > junk.txt

real	0m21.229s
user	0m20.314s
sys	0m0.659s

sfrobu

time ./sfrobu <large.txt >junk.txt

real 4m36.490s
user 0m24.776s
sys  3m31.736s 


We then test with a medium file

sfrob 

time cat medium.txt | ./sfrob > junk.txt
real  0m1.028s
user  0m0.463s
sys   0m0.049s

sfrobu

time ./sfrobu < medium.txt > junk.txt
real	0m1.858s
user	0m0.267s
sys	0m1.232s

small file

sfrob 

time cat small.txt | ./sfrob > junk.txt

real 0m0.169s
user 0m0.139s
sys  0m0.011s

sfrobu

time ./sfrobu < small.txt >junk.txt

real 0m0.979s
user 0m0.097s
sys  0m0.857s


From this we can see that the sfrob program is much fasster at processing the files
than the unbuffered version sfrobu. 
We then look at the all the word counts

wc -l large.txt - 783841 and comparisons 54394668
wc -l medium.txt - 19980 and comparisons 1458029
wc -l small.txt - 6451 and comparisons 427285

If we run a regression on this we get that:

y(comparisons) = 69(lines) + 25579
R^2 = 1


We then look at a comparison of all the functions


sfrob

time cat large.txt | ./sfrob > junk.txt

real    0m21.229s
user    0m20.314s
sys     0m0.659s

sfrobu

time ./sfrobu <large.txt >junk.txt

real 1m57.263s
user 0m11.950s
sys  1m43.921s

sfrobs

time cat large.txt | ./sfrobs > junk.txt

real 0m19.857s
user 0m20.446s
sys  0m0.651s

time cat large.txt | ./sfrobs -f > junk.txt

real 0m21.207s
user 0m22.012s
sys  0m0.643s

time ./sfrobu -f < large.txt > junk.txt

real 1m59.916s
user 0m14.505s
sys  1m43.752s

From the results we see that sfrobs is the fastest function with sfrob, second fastest,
and sfrobu the slowest. We see that both functions with the -f arguments are slightly
slower than their respective functions.
