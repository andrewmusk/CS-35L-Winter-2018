1) Firstly we connect to our beaglebon

sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

We are now connected

2) We then need to connect to wifi

we use the command sudo connmanctl 
to connect

3) We then connect to wifi using the following commands

enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_2cf7f1066b19_6950686f6e65_managed_psk
quit

4) We then update using

sudo apt-get update

5) After this we install xauth and firefox 

6) sudo apt-get install xauth

7) sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

8) dpkg --get-selections | frep openssh

9) We then generate keys 

ssh-keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /root/.ssh/id_rsa
/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
54:df:f1:e6:de:1a:d3:07:16:e0:f1:98:c6:92:c5:0f root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

+-----------------+

From this we generated keys for access with the password 
spacejam.

10) I then added my partner as a user

sudo useradd -d /home/yash -m yashas

11) I then set yash's password using

sudo passwd yashas

"dragon"

12) I then went to cd /home/yash

13) sudo mkdir .ssh

I then allow yash to have access using

sudo chown -R yashas .ssh

14) sudo chmod 700 .ssh

15) I then get the ip address whcih my partner uses to
ssh into my beaglbobe. Yash opened firefox on my machine
and he didn't need his password by using ssh-agent

ifconfig 

and got 192.168.8.1

I then exit.

As a client I do the following operations 

1) sudo ssh -y root@192.168.7.2

2)We now launch the ssh agent so that I am able to login
without using my password

 eval 'ssh-agent -s'

3) ssh-copy-id -i amusk@172.20.10.4

This allows me to add my public key to the server. I enter my password
and I am able to login from now on without using my password again

4) ssh-add 
spacejam

5) ssh amusk@172.20.10.4

I am now able to login without a password

6) firefox

This opened using his machine
