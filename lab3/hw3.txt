Question 1)

Brady's patch removed the code because the line in the code is unnecessary.
After deleting the line, the code performs the same way. The issue with 
the line is that it is repeated below. Since it is a go-to(switch) statement
the code would flow through and perform in the same way. However it is 
good practice to delete this to keep code clean and prevent any further errors

Question 2)

The patch assumes that the reader of the date is an english speaker. Therefore,
the patch would cause some issues in areas where users, aren't used
to reading the date in English. The patch might also cause issues
if there were programs that used the previous date format and now
contain erorrs as the format has changed.

Question 3)
When this script executes it gets an IndexError. The script runs into
this error because it is out of range. The dev/null file is an empty file and
has no lines. This means that when the file is passed into randline and
a random line is choosen, which is greater than 0, and error is produced.
The program checks if the file has less than 0 lines but doesn't check if 
there are 0 lines. 

Question 4)

When the script is run with python3, an invalid syntax error is produced.
This happens because in python2.6, tuples were unpacked automatically. However,
this doesn't happen in python 3 so this is why the error is produced.
