1. We can do this using the command man -k word. 
2. To do this we use which command. The cp file is /usr/local/cs/bin/cp and the wc is /usr/local/cs/bin/wc
3. man -executable
   find / -executable
   The files are in usr/bin 
   The executables are X w and [
   We use man to check these:
   w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
   X - a portable, network-transparent window system
   [ - is a bash built in command for conditional tests

4. readlink -f /usr/bin/emacs
   /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
5. man chmod
   g+s: this sets the group id on execution 
   o-x: this removes the permission for execution by others
6. find / -mtime 21
7. find / -type d -mtime -20
   though permissions don't allow this in root so I check my personal folder /u/cs/ugrad/musk
   
   .
   ./Desktop

8. which find 
   /usr/bin/
   find /usr/bin/ -type l | wc 
   which resulted in 293
9. cd /usr/lib/ 
   ls -alt 
   the oldest file is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0
10. man LOCALE 
 Locale gets its data from environment variables defined in localedef
11. emacs
    C-h a sort
    Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort	

12. I searched this using C-h k C-M-a 
C-M-a
Move backward to the beginning of a defun
C-M-h
Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13.C-h k C-g
C-g runs the command keyboard-quit (found in global-map), which is an
interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to C-g.

(keyboard-quit)

Signal a ‘quit’ condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. C-h f yank
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.

15. The only difference I noticed is that the dired function prints out the hidden directories
and directories that start with '.' The dired function prints what ls -la would print. 

C-x C-d prints out the directories
