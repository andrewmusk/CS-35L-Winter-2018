1) git checkout v3.0 -b quote 

2) we then run 

patch -p1 < ../../quote-3.0-patch.txt

3) From this we see that we have the following changes
   modified:   src/cmp.c
   modified:   src/diff.c
   modified:   src/diff3.c
   modified:   src/dir.c
   modified:   src/sdiff.c
   modified:   src/util.c

4) emacs src/cmp.c
...

In emacs I used the command C-x 4 a to write a changelog entry for each of 
the modified files

5) After this we commit the changes with changelog as the message

git commit -Fa src/ChangeLog

6) Firstly I get the hex for my last commit
This is 6676f3f3abb1ad21dacdccd8dc1d50c950eee9f7.

git format-patch -1 --stdout 6676f3f3abb1ad21dacdccd8dc1d50c950eee9f7 > formatted-patch.txt

This creates the patch

7) scp formatted-patch.txt yashas@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:lab9/hw/diffutils/formatted-patch.txt

This send the file to my partner

8) I then create a new branch to test out my partners patch

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

10) git am ../../yashas-formatted-patch.txt

I was then able to view the contents of his patch which were 

commit dca3bc0b09ea30f6afc975bdd4f5e5a13a29b4da

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt:
        * src/cmp.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'"
        * src/diff.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'" 
        * src/diff3.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'"
        * src/dir.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'"
        * src/sdiff.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'"
        * src/util.c: Changed all of the "`" to "'"

This applied his patch

11) ./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

All works as expected from these commands

I then use make distdir which creates a new directory with the patch. In this I check the changelog
and check that it is the same as the log. This confirms that the patch worked correctly. 

12) I ssh into the seas server using the -Y argument. From here I navigated to the given directory and entered
gitk
