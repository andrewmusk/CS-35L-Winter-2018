Firstly in the top left corner of the screen we see a diagram of the commit graph. This shows a track
of each branch and the commit on the branches. In our case we see a branch merging into master which
is what we are looking for. We see a description of this which says merge master. 

To the right of this is the correspondin list showing the author's name, email and date and time of their
commit. 

We have the commit of merge master selected in this case. Below this we see the SHAI id. Below this
we see a description of the merge with the version name, the parent and child in the tree.
